# A Case Study of Model-Based Testing Using Microsoft Spec Explorer and Validation Framework

As mentioned in the title, this project is a case study of model-based testing using [Dave Arnold](http://davearnold.ca/)'s [Validation Framework](http://vf.davearnold.ca/) and Microsoft's [Spec Explorer](). It was the honours project for my B.C.S at [Carleton University](http://www.carleton.ca/).

## Overview

The abstract for the project can be found [here](http://www.scs.carleton.ca/honours_projects/index.php?details=wylie_0139). As for the technical side, the source code is split into a couple different projects to allow for the testing setup. For both testing platforms, there is a folder suffixed with a platform indicator (eg. SE for Spec Explorer and VF for Validation Framework) containing the Visual Studio solution. In addition to this, there is a folder containing the solution for the stopwatch implementation. Where documentation is concerned, there is a documentation folder containing the project write-up along with test results and a minimal guide for Validation Framework use.
