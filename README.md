# A Case Study of Model-Based Testing Using Microsoft Spec Explorer and Validation Framework

As mentioned in the title, this project is a case study of model-based testing using [Dave Arnold](http://davearnold.ca/)'s [Validation Framework](http://vf.davearnold.ca/) and Microsoft's [Spec Explorer](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/271d0904-f178-4ce9-956b-d9bfa4902745). It was the honours project for my B.C.S at [Carleton University](http://www.carleton.ca/).

## Overview

The abstract for the project can be found [here](http://www.scs.carleton.ca/honours_projects/index.php?details=wylie_0139). As for the technical side; both of the testing platforms and the implementation have a folder containing their Visual Studio solution (indicated by SE, VF and Imp suffixes, respectively). Project documentation is also contained in its own folder which has the project write-up along with test results and a minimal guide for Validation Framework use.

## Setup

At the time of writing, Visual studio 2010 is required to use the Spec Explorer 2010 extension. In addition to these requirements for the implementation and Spec Explorer testing framework, Validation Framework is also required for its tests. It can be found [here](http://vf.davearnold.ca/download.html).
